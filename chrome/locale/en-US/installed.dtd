<!ENTITY spamnessInstalled.introduction.label "Thanks for installing Rspamd-spamness.  To use Rspamd-spamness, you'll need to both re-build folder indices for folders that contain Rspamd-scored mail and enable the 'Spam score' column display for each folder.  If you've installed Rspamd-spamness ahead of setting up any of your accounts, you can completely ignore the rest of this guide - you're all set.">

<!ENTITY spamnessInstalled.folderInstructions.label "To re-index a folder, select it and choose 'Properties...' from the context or Edit menu, then click the 'Repair Folder' button.  You will need to do this for every folder.">

<!ENTITY spamnessInstalled.columnGroup.label "Displaying the 'Spam score' column">
<!ENTITY spamnessInstalled.columnInstructions.label "To display the column in each folder, click the column picker and select the 'Spam score [Rspamd]' column, making sure it's checked and the new column is visible.  To apply it to all folders, click the column picker again, scrolling to the bottom to 'Apply columns to...', then 'Folder and its children...' and choose the top folder for your account.  The column has already been automatically added to the default columns set, but this doesn't affect existing folders.">
